_This page is a list of talking points for discussion surrounding the Munki Road Map_

# Purpose

The purpose of this page is to itemize ideas and suggestions that were made on the munki-dev list.  The hope is that if we can record the ideas as they are made, then there is less of a chance of them falling into the ether and disappearing forever.  This page is **not** the Munki Road Map itself, but rather a list of topics that may make it to the Road Map in the future.
