# What does it mean if an organization is included in this list?
It means someone from the organization publicly at least once gave a presentation or made a blog post about using Munki in some capacity. Though probable, it doesn't necessarily mean the organization as a whole uses Munki or that Munki is used for the entire fleet at that organization. It's certainly possible (though highly unlikely) that someone, representating her or his own organization at a conference, gave an in-depth presentation on Munki but uses Munki only personally at home and not in a work context at all.

# Guidelines for adding to the list
* Do not "out" organizations (companies/schools) you know are using Munki but who haven't publicly disclosed they are using Munki
* Post a link to the publicly available source along with the date of the source
* Keep the list alphabetical by organization name
* List first the name of the organization, the date of the link (or the full time period using Munki, if disclosed), and then the source

# What do the years mean after an organization's name?
That's when the presentation was given or the blog post posted. Sometimes a range of years is evident based on the contents of the presentation/blog, in which case a range is listed. Organizations tend not to implement a solution like Munki for only a year, but it also doesn't make sense to assume "to present" unless you have publicly verifiable information indicating so.
