By default, the command line tools are installed in `/usr/local/munki`, and are automatically added to your `PATH`.

While these wiki pages serve as an introduction to the command line tools, they do not necessarily cover every option and every use-case for the tools.

Running any of the command line tools with the `--help` option will display available options for each tool.
