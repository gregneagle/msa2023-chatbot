_Introduction to Managed Software Center_

### Introduction

Managed Software Center was introduced in Munki 2.

It features a customizable, App Store-like user interface.

Optional installs are front-and-center. Instead of being buried in a hard-to-notice list, they are now the first thing your users see when launching Managed Software Center. Take user empowerment and self-service to the next level by making more items available for self-install.
