### Introduction

Munki 6 is a major new release of the Munki tools. The primary new feature is support for staging an "Install macOS" application, and launching it for the user, temporarily adding admin privileges to the user's account if needed.

### Compatibility

Munki 6 is compatible with Intel and Apple silicon. So far, it's been tested largely on Big Sur, Monterey, and the Ventura betas, but it should work on macOS 10.11 through macOS 13.
