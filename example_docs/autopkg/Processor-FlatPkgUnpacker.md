## Description
Expands a flat package using pkgutil or xar.
    For xar it also optionally skips extracting the payload.

## Input Variables
- **flat\_pkg\_path:**
    - **required:** True
    - **description:** Path to a flat package. Can point to a globbed path inside a .dmg which will be mounted.
- **skip\_payload:**
    - **required:** False
    - **description:** If true, 'Payload' files will be skipped. Defaults to False. Note if this option is used then the files are extracted using xar(1) instead of pkgutil(1). This means components of the package will not be extracted such as scripts.
- **destination\_path:**
    - **required:** True
    - **description:** Directory where archive will be unpacked, created if necessary.
- **purge\_destination:**
    - **required:** False
    - **description:** Whether the contents of the destination directory will be removed before unpacking. Note that unless skip\_payload argument is used the destination directory will be removed as pkgutil requires an empty destination.
